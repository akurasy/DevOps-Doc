If you are using Ubuntu and you encounter an "apt-key deprecated" issue, it means that the apt-key command you are using is outdated and has been deprecated. 
The new recommended method for adding a GPG key for package verification is to use the gpg command directly.

To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:

Remove the old GPG key:

sudo apt-key del <key-id>
Replace <key-id> with the ID of the key that you want to remove.

Download the new GPG key:
wget -qO - <gpg-url> | sudo gpg --dearmor --yes --batch --output /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/<key-file>

Replace <gpg-url> with the URL of the GPG key that you want to add, and <key-file> with the name of the file that you want to save the key as. 
For example, if the URL is https://example.com/key.gpg and you want to save the key as example.gpg, you would replace <gpg-url> with https://example.com/key.gpg 
and <key-file> with example.gpg.

sudo apt-get update

After completing these steps, the new GPG key should be added to the system, and you should be able to install packages without encountering the 
"apt-key deprecated" issue.
