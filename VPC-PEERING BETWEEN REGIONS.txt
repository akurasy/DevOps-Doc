		VPC PEERING
- Create a vpc in one region for public  by following the steps in vpc connection and put only public subnet, IGW and attach to vpc, ROUTE TABLE and edit subnet association,
	edit route and add 0.0.0.0/0 and target= IGW and select te created IGW

- create another vpc for private in another region. put private subnet and route table alone. edit subnet association

- create an ec2 in public subnet region and call it jumpserver. we used mybabatkp as the keypair

- craete another ec2 in private subnet region and call it appserver. we used kachikp as the keypair

from your local, copy the keypair of the appserver to the jumpserver

from your powershell;

scp -i devopkp.pem mybabatkp.pem ec2-user@jumpServer-IP:/home/ec2-user

scp -i devopkp.pem mybabatkp.pem ec2-user@54.205.55.86:/home/ec2-user

ssh into the jumpserver

ssh into the appserver via your jumpserver CLI   

ssh -i appserver-keypair ec2-user@appserver-private-IP ======== this will not work unless your do peering



	PEERING THE VPC
goto vpc console on the public vpc. goto peering connection on the left pan

create connection, on the requester select the public vpc ID, on the acceptor, goto the private VPC and copy the ID of the VPC . the create connection


it will show pending acceptance. now goto the private vpc and click on peering connection. the connection we created on the public vpc will appear here but will be pending.

click on the vpc, click on action and accept connection.

=========================================================

goto your public ec2 CLI and try to ssh into the private server again. it will still fail.

next open an inbound rule on your route table. goto the route table of your private vpc
click on edit route,
copy the CIDR block of the public vpc (10.0.0.0/24) and paste in the destination, select "peering connection" as target
save chnages.

do the same thing for your public route table, edit route and add the CIDR block of the private vpc (172.0.0.0/24) in destination, select peering connection as target
 save changes


ssh again into the private ec2 from your public CLI
ssh -i devopkp.pem ec2-user@172.0.0.19   === this will work now and ypu will ssh into your private server.
